# Layout

list
trigger.sh
add-repo.sh

	The first file is a newline-seprated list of all repositories that we
	know about. This is used to generate the HTML page and restart all the
	jobs each night.

public/travis.html
public/travis.css
public/list.js

	The html/css files are static and should be edited. The JS file is
	generated from `list` above by the `gen-list.py` script.

# Add a new repository

	./add-repo.sh repo-owner/repo-name

This will add to `list` and regenerate `public/list.js`

# Trigger new builds

	./trigger.sh

This is also run in a cron job

# Dependencies

The `travis` command needs to be installed through rubygems.
